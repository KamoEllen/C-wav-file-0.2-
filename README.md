# C-wav-file-0.2-
Simple version :)

This simple program generates a sequence of sample values for a sine wave, and then writes them to a WAV file using the RIFF format. It includes code to write the RIFF header, the format chunk, and the data chunk, as well as the necessary fields for the sample rate, number of channels, and bits per sample.
